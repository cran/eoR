Description: This data management package provides some helper
    classes for publicly available data sources (HMD, DESTATIS) in
    Demography. Similar to ideas developed in the Bioconductor
    project <https://bioconductor.org> we strive to encapsulate data in easy
    to use S4 objects.
    If original data is provided in a text file, the resulting S4
    object contains all information from that text file. But the
    information is somehow structured (header, footer, etc).
    Further the classes provide methods to make a subset for selected
    calendar years or selected regions. The resulting subset
    objects still contain the original header and footer information.
